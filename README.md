# genart
Generative art projects using canvas-sketch and WebGL


Overview
-

Runs off the canvas-sketch utility library. Really well documented (github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/blob/master/docs/README.md).

Most of my newer stuff will have a commit tied to the filename, and the long string of numbers at the end is the random seed. So to recreate an image for whatever reason, say I want to change the color, all I need to do is grab the code from that commit and plug in the seed. 

Use case is usually cranking out a bunch of decent looking graphics in a hurry, but I spend almost as much time just messing around in it. Spamming refresh after finding a good randomized setup is very relaxing.
